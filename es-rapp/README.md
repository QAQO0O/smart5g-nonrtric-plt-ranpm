## Energy Savings rAPP for SMaRT-5G demo

### Manual build, tag and push to image repo

Build for docker or local kubernetes\
`./build.sh no-push [<--tag image-tag>]`

Build for remote kubernetes - an externally accessible image repo (e.g. docker hub) is needed  \
`./build.sh <external-image-repo> [<--tag image-tag>]`


## Function

The rApp reads PM reports created by PM rApp, stored in a common volume. Depending on input data it can:
- Create or delete TS-xApp's traffic policies
- Send request to SDN-Controller to update cell administrative state


### Configuration

The container expects the following environment variables:

- SDN_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS and SDN_CONTROLLER_PORT: Host and port of the SDN Controller

- SDN_CONTROLLER_USERNAME and SDN_CONTROLLER_PASSWORD : Credentials needed to update info stored in SDN-C

- A1T_ADDRESS and A1T_PORT: Host and port of the Near-RT RIC's A1 Termination

- RANSIM_DATA_PATH : Path where input PM reports are stored

- LOAD_PREDICTOR : Address of the Load Predictor model

- LOAD_PREDICTOR_PORT : Port number of the Load Predictor model

- LOAD_PREDICTOR_API : API dedicated for inference.


The rApp tries to connect to SDN-C and A1T in init phase and exits if its not possible.
